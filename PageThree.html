        In 2018, when Thanos and the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six Infinity Stones,
        Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on Titan with the help of the Guardians of the
        Galaxy. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the Time Stone for Stark's life. After
        the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape
        Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by Captain Marvel, who brought them
        back to Earth.
        <br>

        In the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a
        daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method to safely travel through time and space, he rejoined the Avengers
        in their mission to acquire the six Infinity Stones from the past in order to resurrect those killed by the
        Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter and regain the Tesseract. During the Battle of Earth,
        Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who traveled through time to
        collect their Infinity Stones, saving the universe from destruction and leaving behind a legacy as one of
        Earth's most revered superheroes.

        <img src="images/fav scene.jpg" alt="Picture of Iron Man" width="360">
        This scene from the movie is when tony stark is showing off his jerico missile to his buyers and in my opinin
        this is the best scene beacause it is very cool and shows how cool tony can be and also i think it is funny that
        his own missile causes him to have to deel with the arck reactor in his chest.
