                Iron man is my favorit super hero because 1 he actuly dosent have any super powers it is just his souit that he
                made that gives him powers. 2 i also like that he has a quote on quote disability because of the arc reactor in
                his chest to prevent srapnel from killing him by puncturing his heart. 3 i also like his attitued twards things.
