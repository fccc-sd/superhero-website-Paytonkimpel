        Why iron man is so aragent
    </h2>

    <p>
        Tony Stark is arrogant in every MCU movie; it's a key part of his character. In fact lots of male MCU
        protagonists are arrogant (i.e. Star Lord and Dr Strange as well as Stark). <br>

        Tony Stark is arrogant because he is, and has been for all of his life, incredibly, incredibly rich. That makes
        you believe that you can do anything (or at least, get anything done for you) because, usually, you can do
        anything with enough money. <br>

        Secondly, Stark is an exceptional inventor/mechanic. That's clear from the fact that he was able to make the
        first Iron Man suit almost solo (only had a little help from Yinsen), not to mention that he was trapped in a
        cave with only a bunch of scrap to work with [this happens during the first part of the Iron Man movie]. This
        would also bolster anyone's self-esteem: even without his money, Tony could still make a good livelihood and
        possibly start up a new company using his skill and a bit of innovation, should Stark Industries fail (which is
        extremely unlikely). <br>

        Stark's heroic successes as Iron Man also probably improved his opinion of his own awesomeness. (This may have
        been part of the reason for him revealing to the world his secret identity at the end of the first Iron Man
        film.) <br>

    <h2>Why iron man is so strong</h2>

    <p>Iron Man possesses powered armor that gives him superhuman strength and durability, flight, and an array of
        weapons. The armor is invented and worn by Stark (with occasional short-term exceptions). Other people who have
        assumed the Iron Man identity include Stark's long-time partner and best friend James Rhodes; close associates
        Harold "Happy" Hogan; Eddie March; and (briefly) Michael O'Brien.

        The weapons systems of the suit have changed over the years, but Iron Man's standard offensive weapons have
        always been the repulsor rays that are fired from the palms of his gauntlets. Other weapons built into various
        incarnations of the armor include: the uni-beam projector in its chest; pulse bolts (that pick up kinetic energy
        along the way; so the farther they travel, the harder they hit); an electromagnetic pulse generator; and a
        defensive energy shield that can be extended up to 360 degrees. Other capabilities include: generating
        ultra-freon (i.e., a freeze-beam); creating and manipulating magnetic fields; emitting sonic blasts; and
        projecting 3-dimensional holograms (to create decoys).

        In addition to the general-purpose model he wears, Stark has developed several specialized suits for space
        travel, deep-sea diving, stealth, and other special purposes. Stark has modified suits, like the Hulkbuster
        heavy armor. The Hulkbuster armor is composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its
        strength and durability enough to engage the Incredible Hulk in a fight. A later model, designed for use against
        Thor, is modeled on the Destroyer and uses a mystical power source. Stark develops an electronics pack during
        the Armor Wars that, when attached to armors that use Stark technologies, will burn out those components,
        rendering the suit useless. This pack is ineffective on later models. While it is typically associated with
        James Rhodes, the War-Machine armor began as one of Stark's specialty armors.

        The most recent models of Stark's armor, beginning with the Extremis Armor, are now stored in the hollow
        portions of Stark's bones, and the personal area networking implement used to control it is implanted in his
        forearm, and connected directly to his central nervous system.

        The Extremis has since been removed, and he now uses more conventional armors. Some armors still take a liquid
        form, but are not stored within his body. His Endo-Sym Armor incorporates a combination of the liquid
        smart-metal with the alien Venom symbiote, psionically controlled by Stark.

        Post-Secret Wars, Stark uses a more streamlined suit of armor that can practically 'morph' into other armors or
        weapons.
