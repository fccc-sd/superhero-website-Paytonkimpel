    <h2>
        Who iron man is
    </h2>

    <p>
        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the
        weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe
        heart wound, he built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman
        strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam
        War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to
        explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a
        weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the
        stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism,
        and governmental authority.
